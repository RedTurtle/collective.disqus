Overview
--------

Integrates the `Disqus`_ commenting platform in Plone.

Default Plone discussion mechanism doesn't have nice panel to administer
comments. It's hard to find new comments. It's not possible to block posts
with links or some other unwelcome contents.

But on the web there are much more specialized tools for commenting:

- `Disqus`_
- IntenseDebate
- JS-Kit

These commenting platforms can be easyly integrated with sites, users just
need to create an account and add some special code into their websites.

Configuration
-------------

Go to Site Setup -> _`Disqus` comment system control panel form and configure
website short name. _`Disqus` should be visible in all contents that enabled
commenting.
